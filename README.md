# ðŸš— UK Road Accident Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard project provides an interactive and visual exploration of road traffic accidents across several UK districts, including Southend-on-Sea, Chelmsford, Epping Forest, Brentwood, and others. The analysis is based on a detailed dataset with approximately **300,000 rows** of accident records, covering environmental conditions, road surface types, weather, time, and accident severity.
